// put and patch difference
PUT is a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the entire resource . PATCH is a method of modifying resources where the client sends partial data that is to be updated without modifying the entire data.

// localStorage and sessionStorage
These web storage objects are not sent to server with each request, unlike cookies.
the data survives a page refresh (for sessionStorage) and even a full browser restart (for localStorage).

Some methods of both these objects
setItem(key, value) – store key/value pair.
getItem(key) – get the value by key.
removeItem(key) – remove the key with its value.
clear() – delete everything.
key(index) – get the key on a given position.
length – the number of stored items.

In localStorage, he data does not expire. It remains after the browser restart and even OS reboot
SessionStorage is used much less often. Another tab with the same page will have a different storage.

// NO SQl
Data is not stored like relational, but stored like key-value, wide-column or graph etc
Flexibility hai and scaling easy hai
ex mongodb

// can we partition an existing table?
Yes, by using alter table ... add partition
