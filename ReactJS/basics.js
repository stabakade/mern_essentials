// Virtual DOM
// React creates a tree of custom objects representing a part of the DOM. 
// For example, instead of creating an actual DIV element containing a UL element, it creates a React.div object that 
// contains a React.ul object. It can manipulate these objects very quickly without actually touching the real DOM or going through the DOM API. 
// Then, when it renders a component, it uses this virtual DOM to figure out what it needs to do with the real DOM to get the two trees to match.

// You can think of the virtual DOM like a blueprint. It contains all the details needed to construct the DOM, but because 
// it doesn't require all the heavyweight parts that go into a real DOM, it can be created and changed much more easily.

// One should know how to use hooks with dependency arrays. Use case? when we have two search boxes and we want to trigger a function only when we type in a specific box.
